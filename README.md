> React hook for setting State with delay

[![NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/use-delayed-state.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/use-delayed-state) [![JavaScript Style Guide](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-standard-brightgreen.svg)](https://standardjs.com)

This is an enhanced `useState` hook which accepts delay duration for `setState` as an extra parameter.

# Why

It is usefull feature for [debouncing](https://css-tricks.com/debouncing-throttling-explained-examples/#article-header-id-0) which simply delays all consecuative attempts for setting a state to make sure only the last one which persists for certain amount of time is valid as new state.

It is also a handy tool for applying timing logics inside react components e.g. Showing a notification for few seconds.
